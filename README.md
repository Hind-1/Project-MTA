We have been assigned to assist the NYPD in identifying the locations and times where crimes frequently occur on the subway in New York City. Due to the subway's importance in the city's transportation system and its impact on millions of people's lives, it is crucial to ensure its safety. To accomplish this task, we will collect and analyze two datasets: MTA data, NYC crime data, and WMATA data. Our goal is to determine the most commonly used subway stations and the times when arrests, reports, and citations are most frequent during a specified 24-hour period. We will also manipulate the data to gain insights into the patterns of crime on the subway system.

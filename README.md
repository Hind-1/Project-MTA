We were tasked with helping a NYPD to determine the times and subway locations that are usually crime happen New York City.

Since the subway is very essential to NYC transport system and millions of peopleâ€™s lives are connected to the subway system. But is the subway is safe ?

I will work on data collections and manipulations. I am going to collect two datasets. MTA data, NYC crime and WMATA data to show the time and location of arrests, reports and citations for a specified 24-hour period and the most used stations.
